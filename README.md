# Template deployment block

One of the most powerful features in Edge Impulse are the built-in deployment targets (under Deployment in the Studio), which let you create ready-to-go binaries for development boards, or custom libraries for a wide variety of targets that incorporate your trained impulse. You can also create custom deployment blocks for your organization. This lets developers quickly iterate on products without getting your embedded engineers involved, lets your customers build personalized firmware using their own data, or lets you create custom libraries.

This repository contains an example deployment block which builds a Linux binary that runs your impulse. This example is based on [Running your impulse locally on your desktop computer](https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/running-your-impulse-locally).

Learn more about creating a custom deployment block in the Edge Impulse documentation: [Building custom deployment blocks](https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/building-deployment-blocks).
